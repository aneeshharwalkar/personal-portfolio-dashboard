# Portfolio Dashboard

This project is a personal portfolio dashboard concept built entirely using AI-assisted development tools, specifically v0 and Cursor AI. It was created as a learning-focused personal project to explore the capabilities of these tools, understand their limitations, and gain hands-on experience with AI-driven UI prototyping, code generation, and iteration. In parallel, the project served as practice for core Git workflows, including repository setup, version control, and pushing code to GitHub.

## Overview

The dashboard is built with Next.js and TypeScript using a modular, card-based layout and sidebar navigation. The main page presents a high-level portfolio summary, followed by sections for daily performance, market movers, industry trends, and diversification suggestions. All data is currently mocked to keep the focus on layout design, component structure, and overall user experience rather than live data integration.

This project intentionally emphasizes experimentation with v0 for rapid UI generation and Cursor AI for code refinement, restructuring, and learning modern frontend patterns through AI-assisted development.

## Features

- Portfolio overview with performance summary  
- Personal and market-wide daily movers  
- Industry and sector trend insights  
- AI-style diversification suggestions  
- Watchlist, search, and notifications pages  
- Modular component architecture designed for extension  

## Tech Stack

- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- v0 (AI-powered UI prototyping)  
- Cursor AI (AI-assisted development and iteration)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Data and API Integration

The dashboard currently uses mock data. API integration was intentionally deferred to focus on learning AI development tools and frontend structure. Integrating live stock market data, news APIs, and earnings calendars is planned as the next phase of the project.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are included to demonstrate the intended layout, interactions, and user experience without requiring viewers to install dependencies or run the project locally.

## Purpose

This project represents a first end-to-end experiment with AI-assisted development tools. It was built to understand how v0 and Cursor AI can accelerate prototyping, guide code structure, and support learning modern frontend workflows, while also reinforcing Git and GitHub best practices through real project usage.
