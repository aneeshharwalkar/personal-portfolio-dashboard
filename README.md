# Portfolio Dashboard

This project is a personal portfolio dashboard concept for tracking stocks, market movers, watchlist activity, and upcoming earnings. It was built as a learning project and is my first hands-on experience using AI-assisted development tools, including v0 and Cursor AI.

## Overview

The dashboard is built with Next.js and TypeScript using a modular, card-based layout and sidebar navigation. The main page provides a high-level portfolio overview, followed by sections for daily performance, stock news, earnings, and watchlist insights. All data is currently mocked to keep the focus on layout, structure, and component design.

This project was created to explore how v0 can speed up UI prototyping and how Cursor AI can support development through code generation, refactoring, and rapid iteration.

## Features

- Portfolio overview with performance summary  
- Personal and market-wide daily movers  
- News section scoped to owned or watched stocks  
- Upcoming earnings section  
- Watchlist, search, and notifications pages  
- Modular components designed for future API integration  

## Tech Stack

- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- v0 (UI prototyping)  
- Cursor AI (AI-assisted development)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Data and API Integration

The dashboard currently uses mock data. The project structure supports future integration with stock market APIs, news APIs, and earnings calendars via environment variables.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are included to show the intended layout and user experience without requiring viewers to install dependencies or run the project locally.

## Purpose

This project was built as a first experiment with AI-assisted development tools. It demonstrates how v0 and Cursor AI can be used to prototype interfaces quickly, structure a project effectively, and learn modern frontend workflows.
